# ✨ rtfw-base64

![build](https://github.com/RTFW-rs/rtfw-base64/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a lazy implementation of Base64 from scratch to learn how it works.

## Context

I was playing with [OAuth PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) and ended up facing some issues with Base64.
After fixing them, I thought to myself that writing a Base64 encoder from scratch should not be too hard.

So, there it is.
